# How to Add Facebook Pixel to Wordpress
{{TOC}}

## How do you install a Facebook Pixel on your WordPress site?

Planning on running ad campaigns for your eCommerce store?

Adding the Facebook Pixel to your Wordpress site is a bit daunting at first, but you'll have filtering options to customize ads for your target audience. But before we get to the good stuff, let's find out what this tool is about.

## Facebook Pixel Overview
In simpler terms, Facebook Pixel is a code that you place on your WordPress website. It tracks website visitors, their activities, and what they do when they visit your website again.

When those visitors open up Facebook, they'll see your advertisement. That’s called retargeting. When you add Facebook Pixel to your Wordpress site, it helps you sync your website data that you can use for retargeting campaigns.

Marketers love these insights, and Facebook Pixel does satisfy their demand of getting more insights from the ad campaigns. More insights mean it allows them to tweak ads to improve conversion rates.

The whole process is complex yet effective. But regular marketers who create and manage Facebook ad campaigns daily, or anyone who has hands-on experience with the tool knows what to do and how it is done.

## Back when pixels were cumbersome and confusing
Before 2015, there were different Facebook Pixels for tracking, optimizing, and remarketing. After that, Facebook introduced what they call One Pixel for all. The Facebook Pixel that we use today can track, optimize, and do remarketing.

## Creating and Adding the Facebook Pixel to your Wordpress website

Open Facebook Business Dashboard and look for Connect to Data Source Option

Once you click on Connect to Data Sources, you will see the option to choose to connect it to web, app, and offline. Click on the 'web' option.


Then, you will see the two options for the connection method, one with Conversion API and the other with Facebook Pixel – Choose Facebook Pixel.

The next screen asks you about the details.

You can choose the "manually upload the code of use a partner integration." In the case of partner integration, you don’t have to update the website code. Facebook offers partners integrations with Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, and others. In the case of manual, choose the 'manual' option.

Now, you have to paste the code on your website. If you are doing it manually, you should paste it at the bottom of the header of the website, just above the head tag.

## DIY or Hire a Developer?

If you have a developer managing your website, then while you create the Pixel code, you will see the option of Email Instructions, you can put your developer’s email containing the instructions to complete the process from the website’s end.

The developer can take charge of the task from there. Hiring certified Facebook Marketing Developers means you can fine-tune campaigns to the smallest detail and continue serving ads when new privacy policies arise. If you are managing the ad campaigns, coordinate with your developer to see if the code has been placed correctly.

You'll start seeing the data on the Facebook Pixel dashboard if the code is placed properly. If you have a marketer to handle your marketing tasks, then connect your developer with the marketer for a smooth transition.

## How does Facebook Pixel work?
Once the code is generated and pasted on the website, Facebook gives you certain pre-loaded events which you can run simply by copy-pasting the particular event’s code.

### The pre-loaded events in Facebook Pixel:  

**Lead**: When a visitor on your website and signs up for a trial version, it is identified as a lead on the website

**Complete Registration**: When a website visitor registers on your form and submits it after. That's counted as a complete registration.

**Add Payment Info**: When the buyer inserts payment info during the purchase process regardless of whether they made a purchase or not, they will be counted under the add payment info event.

**Add to cart**: When the buyer adds the product to the cart, whether or not he/she makes the purchase, it will be counted under the add to cart event.

**Purchase**: When the buyer makes the purchase after completing the buying process, it comes under the purchase event.

**Subscribe**: When the website visitor subscribes to your paid service or a product that comes under the subscription event.

**Contact**: When a website visitor initiates contact on the website, he/she will go under the contact event.

**View content**: When a website visitor simply visits the page to gather info and spends time on it.

There are many other pre-loaded events offered by Facebook Pixel. You can also create your custom events based on your business model and website services. For example, you can create a custom event to see how many views you got on a particular service page or product category page on your website.

Knowing which product categories or which products are being viewed most, but people are not buying them or leaving their cart without completing the process, you can target those products in Facebook ads to those people. That’s why the whole setup of Facebook Pixel and Facebook Ads was organized.

The same goes for the ones who left the subscription page without subscribing or just view the content and took no action. Good marketers know how to play with such data.

## Wrapping up
If you want to create better-converting Facebook Ads and target your ads better, then installing Facebook Pixel is a must. Facebook Pixel ensures that your ads are seen by the people who are likely to act.

An action (or "microconversions") could be anything from subscribing to your plan, buying an eBook, taking up a course, or buying from your eCommerce store. Just like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel as well starts sending you the data as soon as you install the Facebook Pixel code.

If you haven’t run an ad on Facebook yet, you can still add the Facebook Pixel to your wordpress website. By the time you start a campaign on Facebook, you’ll have sufficient data to run a successful campaign.

Are you ready to try your hands on the Facebook Pixel for better ads?
